# RE-MOCT roadmap

## Direction (decided)
Linux-first to establish a clean core/platform boundary, **then** plugin-ability,
with **iHeart extracted as the first real loadable plugin** as the proof of the
plugin system. Porting forces the boundary clean; an interface proven across two
platforms is more trustworthy. Get there in two moves: prove an internal
compile-time Source interface first, **then** harden it into a C-ABI DLL/SO. Don't
carve the ABI first.

> **Spotify is dropped for now.** It was the thing that tempted us to pull plugins
> ahead of the Linux port; without it, the original ordering is cleaner. The
> Source-interface design stays transport-agnostic (see `architecture.md`) so a
> future sidecar-style service plugin remains possible, but it is not on the plan.

## Phases (in order)
- **Phase 0 — offline unit-test safety net: ✅ DONE (in the form pursued).** The
  pure-unit half landed and is verified: `IHeartNowPlayingSM` (now-playing decision
  logic — threadless, no network) and `ar_crc` (AccurateRip CRC math) extracted as pure
  units with offline `ctest` coverage (`iheart_sm_test`, `ar_crc_test`). **Honest scope:
  the originally-envisioned full streaming record/replay harness was NOT built** — the
  safety net took the form of pure extractions + offline unit tests, which proved
  sufficient to make the Phase 1 seam work safe. A true capture/replay harness remains
  available to build later if a future refactor needs it.
- **Phase 1 — platform abstraction / cleanup.** Replace platform-specific calls with
  seams (interfaces), not `#ifdef`s:
  - HTTP: consolidate the per-module WinINet GET helpers behind one `core::IHttp`
    seam (Linux = libcurl later; later still, host provides transport to plugins).
    Migrated in groups, split by verification method:
    - **slice 1 / group (a) — GET/JSON: ✅ DONE** (commit `94eb8cb`): MBLookup +
      RadioBrowser. See Done section.
    - **group (b) — POST scrobble: ✅ DONE** (commit `7c13baf`): LastFm + ListenBrainz.
      See Done section.
    - **group (c) — bytes + redirect: ✅ DONE** (commit `dd5f792`): CoverArt + CDRipper
      (AR/CTDB). See Done section. **`hlsHttpGet` was pulled OUT of (c)** and deferred —
      it was not a clean one-shot.
    - **slice 4 — the audio-thread pair (sites 7 & 8): ✅ DONE** (commit `4c72b09`):
      StreamSource `hlsHttpGet` + IHeart metadata, via the cancel-token +
      persistent-session (`IHttpSession`) extension. **HTTP consolidation is 8/8 —
      fully closed.** The fork is resolved: both sites migrated. See Done section.
      The live StreamSource audio read loop (`InternetReadFile`→ring) stays OUT
      entirely, permanently — proven byte-identical by diff in slice 4.
  - **slice 5 — core/platform directory reorg (HTTP seam): ✅ DONE** (commit
    `1977539`): `include/core/` + `src/platform/win/` established on the finished
    HTTP seam. See Done section. The remaining seams below BUILD INTO this
    structure (interfaces → `include/core/`, Windows impls → `src/platform/win/`);
    they are not relocated later.
  - **slice 6 — IPC: Discord named-pipe → `core::IIpc`: ✅ DONE** (commit `89285d8`):
    the first seam built INTO the slice-5 structure. See Done section. (Linux =
    Unix socket, Phase 3.)
  - **slice 7 — notifications: Toast/PowerShell → `core::INotify`: ✅ DONE** (commit
    `dde7041`): third seam built INTO the slice-5 structure; second ctor-injection
    consumer. See Done section. (Linux = libnotify/notify-send, Phase 3.)
  - **slice 8 — CD access: Windows IOCTL → `core::ICdIo`: ✅ DONE** (commit
    `14aebec`): the LAST platform seam — Phase 1's seam work is complete. See
    Done section. (Linux = SG_IO on /dev/srN, Phase 3.)
  - Clear the parked concurrency debt where cheap.
- **Phase 2 — internal Source interface: ✅ DONE** (slices 0/A/B landed; slice
  C formally DECLINED by decision, 2026-07-03 — see below and the Decisions
  log). The goal — an internal compile-time `core::ISource` proven against all
  four real sources (local file, iHeart, ICY, CD) with zero new dependencies —
  was achieved at slice B under the slice-0 replay net + live gates.
  **Design approved (2026-07-02):**
  `core::ISource` at `include/core/ISource.h` — readFrames (the audio-callback
  contract, fixed 44100/stereo/f32) / caps (seekable, finite, live) /
  positionSec / durationSec / seekTo / close. **`open()` and metadata are
  deliberately OUT of the v1 contract** (see Decisions log). Slices:
  - **slice 0 — thin replay net: ✅ DONE** (commit `7adae12`): the regression
    net for the whole phase — see Done section. These tests retarget through
    `ISource*` in slice A and gate every later slice.
  - **slice A — contract + push sources: ✅ DONE** (commit `0b7acf4`): ISource
    landed; StreamSource + CDSource implement it (signature harmonization only —
    concurrency boxes provably unopened: `src/StreamSource.cpp` diff EMPTY,
    sacred-symbol grep over the full diff zero hits); pipeline tests retarget
    through `ISource*`. See Done section.
  - **slice B — LocalFileSource extraction: ✅ DONE** (commit `845a155`): the
    heaviest slice — the audio-thread swap became a pointer move + RETIREMENT
    under the unchanged release/acquire protocol. See Done section.
  - **slice C — callback dispatch through ISource*: ❌ DECLINED** (2026-07-03,
    go/no-go assessment, Dos confirmed). Not "polish not worth it" — the polish
    is INCORRECT: a single active-`ISource*` is factually wrong for the file
    branch, which runs TWO live sources during a crossfade (varispeed needs the
    file source specifically; the mix and gapless fill read `next_src_`) — only
    3 of the 6 callback readFrames sites could even use it. The real costs were
    structural, not the (unmeasurable) vtable: a second source of truth for
    "what's playing" that can disagree with the mode flags mid-transition (the
    teardown-ordering class slice 0 guards), and a fourth audio-thread change
    class (the pointer goes stale at every swap — the F2 lesson replayed). The
    mode flags/branches stay regardless (file-only ReplayGain, CD-only live-BPM,
    per-branch buffering/track-end are semantics, not debt). Nothing downstream
    needs it: Phase 3 recompiles the portable core unchanged; Phase 4's plugin
    dispatch is its own boundary. Virtual dispatch through the interface is
    already proven on every ctest run (the pipeline tests drive the real
    machinery through `ISource&`).
- **Phase 3 — Linux port. IN PROGRESS** (kickoff 2026-07-03; readiness survey +
  slicing approved — `docs/phase3-readiness.md`). Forces the boundary clean. WSL2
  (Debian Trixie, provisioned on 7of9) as the fast inner loop, GitHub Actions
  matrix (windows msys2/UCRT64 + debian:trixie container) as the source of truth.
  Strictly a PARITY port — no new features, no visual changes. Approved slicing:
  - **slice 0 — CI matrix + env + seam stubs: ✅ DONE** (commit `27735f5`): see
    Done section. CD-gate venue RESOLVED on evidence: usbipd→WSL2, no VM.
  - **slice 1 — portable core compiles + links on Linux: ✅ DONE** (the
    platform-util layer, the mechanical de-Win32 classes, whole-file `_WIN32`
    wraps de-gated, StreamSource header detox with the sacred ICY loop gated
    VERBATIM; MD5 stayed a Linux placeholder — vendoring rides with slice 2 as
    decided). Gate PASSED: remoct played a WAV to completion on Linux
    (PulseAudio sink-input live) + Windows ctest 13/13 before AND after. See
    Done section.
  - **slice 2 — HTTP: libcurl IHttp: ✅ DONE** (sessions, cancel token,
    RedirectPolicy, read_error; vendored MD5 both platforms; http_cancel_test
    made portable — one file, both transports). See Done section.
  - **slice 3 — ICY raw-loop Linux twin: ✅ DONE** (commit `5c823f8`; design
    doc `docs/phase3-slice3-design.md` ratified pre-code): curl CONNECT_ONLY +
    curl_easy_recv, pull-read shape verbatim, offset-0 invariant. Gate PASSED:
    live station audible on Linux (Pulse RMS 6393), StreamTitle across 2+
    transitions, prompt switch; Windows preprocessed TU bit-identical. New
    both-platform `icy_pipeline_test` closes the slice-0 "ICY live-gate-only"
    limit. See Done section. **The platform boundary's raw-transport work is
    complete** — slices 4/5/6 are seam impls.
  - **slice 4 — IPC: Unix-socket IIpc: ✅ DONE — 100% CLOSED** (design doc
    `docs/phase3-slice4-design.md` ratified pre-code): `IpcUnixSocket.cpp`
    (`platform::lnx::UnixSocketIpc`), the WinPipeIpc sibling. Gates PASSED —
    Windows 16/16 (UIManager preprocessed TU bit-identical), Linux 13/13,
    live socat echo probe, AND live Discord RP from Linux via the
    npiperelay bridge (real Discord accepted title/artist + iTunes art,
    survived an on-air track change). See Done section. **Final 100% close
    CONFIRMED: Dos verified on a native Debian 13 desktop with a real Discord
    install — end-to-end all good (native socket discovery, no bridge).**
  - **slice 5 — notify: libnotify.** Gate: real notification via dunst;
    headless = documented best-effort no-op (the contract).
  - **slice 6 — CD: SG_IO ICdIo — LAST.** Gate: Relish rip via usbipd/WSL2 on
    the GHD3N: 12/12 AR v2 conf 200 AND byte-identical to the Windows baseline
    log (every CRC/frame450/"C2 support" line) — conf-200 alone is not the bar.
- **Phase 4 — plugin-ize.** Harden the Source interface into a loadable C-ABI
  `.dll`/`.so` boundary, and **extract iHeart as the first real plugin** — the test
  of the whole plugin system. ("Fix iHeart and ship without rebuilding the host.")

## Done (restructure branch)
- **Phase 3 slice 4 — IPC: Unix-domain-socket core::IIpc twin: DONE** (code
  `671d2b3`; design `docs/phase3-slice4-design.md`, ratified before code).
  `src/platform/linux/IpcUnixSocket.cpp` (`platform::lnx::UnixSocketIpc` /
  `UnixSocketChannel`) — the WinPipeIpc sibling, mapping the three primitives
  onto what they were shaped for at slice 6: **send** = one `::send()` with
  `MSG_NOSIGNAL` (LOAD-BEARING: dead peer → `false` like WriteFile, not a
  SIGPIPE death); **waitReadable** = the Windows 10 ms peek-poll loop shape
  verbatim, `poll()`+`FIONREAD` in PeekNamedPipe's slot (queued bytes count
  toward min_bytes even after peer close — pinned on the Windows baseline
  first; the wait slice wakes early on arriving data, latency-only named
  accepted-better); **recvSome** = one blocking `::recv()`, EOF → false;
  EINTR retried throughout (ncurses' SIGWINCH must not read as a broken
  channel). Endpoint discovery in the impl: base = `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` →
  `$TMPDIR`/`$TMP`/`$TEMP` → `/tmp` (canonical discord-rpc order), plain
  first then flatpak/snap subdirs — the Discord-install knowledge leak NAMED
  and accepted at design review (DiscordRP stays zero-diff; Windows identical
  by construction). SeamStubs shed StubIpc + the ipc() bridge. DiscordRP.cpp/
  .h and IpcWinPipe.cpp: **zero diff**; IIpc.h doc-comments only. UIManager
  Discord gate sweep (the slice-2 "^D comes alive at slice 4" promise): dtor
  art-join, startDiscordArtLookup, the RP block, stopped-state clear, the
  early-return term, the ^D case — all common now; **Windows UIManager
  preprocessed TU bit-identical to baseline** (the cmp caught a 1-line
  re-flow of the un-gated if-condition — fixed by keeping the baseline's own
  line breaks; lessons.md). Tests: discord_ipc_test portable (IPC_IMPL
  pattern, pure protocol — 12th Linux target); NEW both-platform
  **ipc_echo_test** (13th) — a REAL local server through the REAL impl
  (CreateNamedPipe fixture / Unix-socket listener in a sandboxed
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR): whole-buffer send, waitReadable min_bytes/timeout/
  broken-peer semantics, recvSome byte-accounting drain + EOF, dead-peer send
  false-with-process-alive (the MSG_NOSIGNAL regression case), buffered-then-
  close, and the Linux flatpak/snap/env discovery order — run green on the
  UNTOUCHED Windows impl FIRST (slice-3 baseline-first pattern). Verified:
  Windows ctest 15/15 baseline → 16/16 after; Linux 13/13 first run. **Live
  gates:** socat echo probe — the real DiscordRP + real impl against a real
  external Unix socket, handshake `{"v":1,...}` and SET_ACTIVITY observed on
  the wire as ONE write per frame; **live Discord RP from Linux via the
  npiperelay+socat bridge** (Windows Discord's pipe as a genuine Unix socket
  — the wire capture shows production Discord's READY for the logged-in
  user, "Doja Cat - Say So" ACCEPTED with the remoct_logo asset resolved,
  the async iTunes art refresh ACCEPTED (`mp:external/...600x600bb.jpg`), a
  natural on-air track change (Ariana Grande) pushed through, and after a
  bridge kill+restart the NEXT track (JoJo) drove the lazy reconnect: failed
  send → disconnect → fresh handshake + restored RP with art). Honest
  limits, documented: the bridge's socket is socat's (flatpak/snap
  candidates stay fixture-proven); Windows live ^D is a formality (TU
  bit-identical; the same Discord displayed the Linux RP). **100% CLOSE
  CONFIRMED: Dos verified on a native Debian 13 desktop with a real Discord
  install — end-to-end all good, native socket discovery (no bridge).** (code `5c823f8`;
  design `docs/phase3-slice3-design.md`, ratified before code). The LAST raw
  transport: StreamSource's continuous ICY path now has a Linux twin — curl
  `CONNECT_ONLY=1` (TCP+TLS) + hand-spoken HTTP/1.0 ICY request + hand-parsed
  response headers ("ICY 200 OK" tolerance is OURS — that's the feature) +
  `curl_easy_recv` in `InternetReadFile`'s refill slot, preserving the
  pull-read shape verbatim. **Windows byte-verbatim held at the strongest
  standard: the preprocessed `_WIN32` translation unit is bit-identical to
  baseline (`g++ -E -P` diff EMPTY);** every deleted diff line was inside the
  two slice-1 Linux placeholder stubs. THE correctness crux (offset-0
  invariant): bytes received past the header terminator prime `raw_buf_`, so
  `readAudio()`'s transport-blind metaint arithmetic stays exact; `hConn_`
  (the slice-1 void* twin) holds the CURL* so the shared `onRead`/`rawRead`
  null-guards work unmodified; redirects by hand via the portable
  hlsResolveUrl twin (cap 5); stop_ polled per 100 ms recv-wait slice with an
  8 s dry bound mirroring RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (close on a blocked read measured
  **7703 ms Windows / 75 ms Linux** — the named accepted-better delta).
  **Probe-first paid twice:** (1) ALPN must be DISABLED
  (`CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPN=0`) — with it, cloudflare negotiates HTTP/2 and
  the hand-written request dies; (2) baseline finding — **WinINet yields
  `icy_metaint=0` on an "ICY 200 OK" status line** (true SHOUTcast v1):
  Windows plays via ADTS/MP3 resync but never parses titles there — reality
  pinned per-platform in the test; the twin parses ICY status (named better).
  New **`icy_pipeline_test`** (both platforms): a REAL localhost ICY server
  through the REAL Continuous pipeline — run green on the UNTOUCHED Windows
  baseline FIRST (slice-B pattern); covers metaint alignment across two title
  transitions, Icy-MetaData request, server-drop reconnect self-heal, bounded
  close, no-metaint passthrough — closes the slice-0 honest limit ("ICY
  cannot be replayed headlessly"). Verified: Windows ctest 15/15, Linux
  11/11. **Live gates:** Linux TUI played Dance Wave (https + cloudflare
  redirect followed live, MP3 continuous path) — Pulse sink-monitor RMS 6393
  / 99.97% non-zero, StreamTitle across 2+ transitions in the [LIVE] display
  (6 flips logged + a real song change on SomaFM), station switch → new
  connect ~1.4 s after keypress, metaint 16384/45000 parsed live; Windows
  non-event proven live (same two stations through the verbatim path via a
  temp harness — titles, RMS, close 15 ms/0 ms). Five wild station shapes
  probe-validated pre-code (http, https, ICY-status v1, no-metaint,
  multi-hop redirect). Test-infra gotcha recorded: ^U takes URL THEN a
  station-name prompt (Enter skips) — script the full prompt flow.
- **Phase 3 slice 2 — HTTP: libcurl core::IHttp + vendored MD5, both platforms
  green: DONE.** Design doc: `docs/phase3-slice2-design.md` (approved before
  code). `src/platform/linux/HttpCurl.cpp` (`platform::lnx::CurlHttp`/
  `CurlSession`) — the WinINet sibling, same TU layout, `core::http()/setHttp()`
  with the identical g_override shape. Key mappings (full table in the design
  doc): **sessions = a held CURLSH share handle** (CONNECT+DNS+SSL_SESSION
  caches, mutex-locked) + one easy handle PER fetch via CURLOPT_SHARE — keep-
  alive reuse across fetches AND thread-safe concurrent fetches (single shared
  easy handle rejected: can't run two transfers); **cancel** = pre-check + XFER-
  INFOFUNCTION polling the atomic (accepted-better residual: cancel works during
  CONNECT on Linux, WinINet can't); **timeout_ms = CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS + LOW_
  SPEED_LIMIT/TIME stall guard, deliberately NOT CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS** (a whole-
  transfer deadline would kill healthy slow downloads — behavior WinINet never
  had); FollowSameScheme = REDIR_PROTOCOLS_STR pinned to the original scheme;
  WinINet cache flags = no-op (curl has no client cache); proxy = env-var
  convention. SeamStubs dropped StubHttp + the http bridges. **MD5 vendored as
  byte-verbatim upstream `lib/md5.{h,c}`** (Peslyak/Openwall public domain) +
  `extern "C"` — approved deviation from the design's header-only shape
  (unmodified upstream = smaller trust surface, the "verbatim moves are safer"
  principle); root CMake gains LANGUAGES C; LastFm::md5Hex = ONE code path both
  platforms (CryptoAPI block + slice-1 Linux placeholder both deleted). New
  `md5_test` (RFC 1321 vectors + 55/56/64/65 padding boundaries + a raw-UTF-8
  api_sig-shaped vector, every custom vector independently confirmed against
  Python hashlib). **Tests now portable via HTTP_IMPL/HTTP_LIBS:** http_cancel
  (platform shim; scenario B = live proof the CURLSH pool reuses ONE TCP
  connection), scrobble_request, group_c_request, iheart_request, hls_pipeline.
  **Windows 14/14, Linux 4→10/10.** Hard-won fix: first Linux run hung forever —
  POSIX close() does NOT wake a thread blocked in accept() (Windows closesocket
  does); fixed with shutdown-then-close (stopListener) + ctest TIMEOUT 60 so the
  hang class fails CI fast (lessons.md). **Live gates on Linux, all through the
  real libcurl transport:** MB standalone probe fed the REAL Relish TOC from the
  2026-06-21 rip log → `Joan Osborne — Relish (1995)`, all 12 track titles
  (in-app CD→MB flow re-verifies at slice 6); RadioBrowser search in the TUI
  returned KWIN 97.7 (the group-(a) twin); digital iHeart HLS (Z100 zc1469)
  PLAYED — segment pump at edgeLag 0, FDK 48→44.1k, live iHeart nowPlaying
  through the CurlSession, and audible-output proof: 4 s off the Pulse sink
  monitor at RMS 5791 / 100% non-zero samples. **Scrobble round-trips PASSED
  both platforms** (standalone probe, Dos's real keys, run after the commit at
  Dos's order): Windows/WinINet — the MD5-vendoring wire regression —
  updateNowPlaying + scrobble ACCEPTED by Last.fm (api_sig signed by the
  vendored MD5), ListenBrainz validate (RadMageIRL) + single ACCEPTED; Linux/
  libcurl — the identical four calls ACCEPTED, Björk/Jóga accents over raw
  UTF-8 POSTFIELDS. **Slice-2 follow-up (Dos-found on the Debian VM, fixed
  same day):** ^U/^G/^B dead on Linux — NOT the terminal: a single `#ifdef
  _WIN32` around Ctrl+D in handleInput's key switch spanned ^D/^B/^F/^G/^U/
  ^Y/^R, deleting the portable handlers from the Linux build; a minimal-curses
  key probe proved the tty delivers all the codes (so the slice-1 IXON-only
  termios stays — ISIG/IEXTEN were NOT taken). Fix = per-case gates with the
  reason on each; ^B/^G/^U now common; ^D (Discord, slice 4), ^F (MBSearch
  overlay handlers still win-gated), ^Y/^R (CD, slice 6) stay gated — those
  three keys come alive with their slices. Verified: ^U/^G/^B open their
  prompts in the Linux TUI, ^Q quits; Windows 14/14 (preprocessed output
  unchanged); Linux 10/10. Findings recorded, not fixed (parked below):
  logDir grandparent mkdir; radio-browser nl1/at1 mirrors DNS-dead (de1
  fine, fallback loop works).
- **Phase 3 slice 1 — portable core compiles, links, and PLAYS on Linux: DONE.**
  The whole-file `#ifdef _WIN32` gates came off 21 files (11 TUs + 10 headers);
  `include/PortUtil.h` landed with the rule that makes it safe: **every helper's
  Windows expansion is the baseline call verbatim** (sleepMs==::Sleep,
  tickMs==::GetTickCount incl. uint32 wrap shape, fopenUtf8==_wfopen(utf8_to_wide)),
  so adoption is a rename, not a behavior change. Per-file: CDSource/IHeartRadio/
  DiscordRP (getpid twin) trivial; Log + IHeartDeepLog rewritten portable
  (std::filesystem/chrono/localtimeSafe; same dated-file/trim/heartbeat
  contracts; Linux logs → $XDG_STATE_HOME/re-moct per the XDG decision); CDRipper
  mechanical (fopenUtf8 ×~30, kSep per-platform separator so Windows rip logs
  stay byte-identical for the slice-6 diff gate, buildOutputDir Windows branch
  verbatim + XDG_MUSIC_DIR twin, DWORD→uint32_t word-boundary safe); LastFm MD5
  = deliberate Linux placeholder ("" api_sig — slice 2 vendors the real one both
  platforms, as decided); **StreamSource detox: the ICY raw transport (connect's
  WinINet body, the rawRead InternetReadFile loop) moved INSIDE `#ifdef _WIN32`
  byte-verbatim — on Linux connect() refuses Continuous mode with a clear error
  until the slice-3 twin; HLS path fully portable (hlsResolveUrl got a portable
  RFC-3986-ish twin for InternetCombineUrlA); HINTERNET members exist as inert
  void* twins so the machinery compiles unreferenced**; AudioManager/UIManager.h
  member gates stripped; ShellExecuteA → xdg-open twin; utf8_to_wide got a Linux
  UTF-32 twin (reuses utf8_next — one decoder for draw + column math); version
  tag per-platform (-win byte-identical / -linux). Audits: zero sacred symbols
  in the StreamSource diff (ringClear/prebuffered_/ring machinery all context);
  every StreamSource change line in 5 enumerated classes (Sleep/tick renames,
  DWORD→uint32_t, gate insertion, include swap, hlsResolveUrl split); no
  unguarded platform includes outside src/platform/win; PortUtil.h included
  from .cpp files only. **Gate: on WSL2 Trixie, remoct's TUI came up in a tmux
  pty, browsed, and played a 20 s WAV to COMPLETION — progress bar/bitrate/BPM
  readouts live, PulseAudio sink-input "remoct" uncorked — and Windows ctest
  ran 13/13 both before and after the port edits (baseline first, regression
  after). Linux ctest 4/4. CI Linux job now builds the FULL remoct binary.**
  **Slice-1 follow-up (Dos-found on the independent Debian VM, fixed same
  day):** (1) Ctrl+Q dead on Linux — CONFIRMED IXON: cbreak() leaves tty
  flow control on, so the driver ate ^Q/XON before curses saw key 17; fixed
  by clearing IXON via termios in the UIManager ctor, Linux-only (raw() was
  rejected — it also takes ISIG). (2) Resize didn't redraw — root cause was
  OUR OWN `#ifndef _WIN32` SIGWINCH handler in main.cpp DISPLACING ncursesw's,
  so KEY_RESIZE was never queued; fixed by deleting it — the existing
  KEY_RESIZE relayout path now runs. (3) Ctrl+U radio confirmed EXPECTED-dead
  (HTTP stub until slice 2, ICY slice 3) and graceful — app alive, no crash.
  Verified: ^Q clean exit + resize relayout + ^U graceful all in the WSL2
  pty; Windows 13/13 again (both changes Linux-only). Remaining nits:
  config-dir casing (~/.config/RE-MOCT vs re-moct state dir) parked; live
  Windows listen spot-check still with Dos.
- **Phase 3 slice 0 — CI matrix + Linux env + seam stubs: DONE** (readiness
  survey + approval: docs `ebf5382`; code `27735f5`). The survey's decisive
  findings (full detail in `docs/phase3-readiness.md`): the tree is pervasively
  whole-file `#ifdef _WIN32`-gated (a naive Linux build = empty shell), so the
  survey de-gated all 23 TUs and compiled them against real Trixie headers —
  **12/23 clean today**, the rest classified (trivial Sleep/localtime →
  mechanical file/time APIs → LastFm MD5 decision → structural: StreamSource
  raw ICY loop + gated UIManager/AudioManager members). Both known-unknowns
  GREEN: ncursesw on Linux = COLORS=256/PAIRS=65536 + wide-API round-trip 3/3
  (the COLORS=8 ceiling was a Windows/MSYS2-terminfo artifact); miniaudio =
  PulseAudio backend live in WSL2, 27k frames through the real callback at
  44100/stereo/f32. CMake configures on Linux UNCHANGED; the 4 pure suites
  passed on Linux before any changes. **CD gate resolved on evidence: the
  GHD3N is USB (JMicron bridge, busid 4-1) — usbipd-win 5.3.0 attached it to
  WSL2 as a real scsi3-mmc `/dev/sr0`+`/dev/sg4`; sg_inq INQUIRY, cdparanoia
  full TOC (12 tracks — Relish, T1 LBA 32 = MSF 182 − the 150 preamble,
  conventions reconciling exactly as pinned), and a raw READ CD 0xBE returned
  SCSI Good, 2352 bytes, byte-identical on re-read. No VM.** Landed: CI
  workflow (debian:trixie container job — matched with the WSL2 loop,
  non-free enabled for fdk-aac; windows msys2/UCRT64 job, full suite);
  `src/platform/linux/SeamStubs.cpp` (inert contract-failure stubs + the four
  core:: link-time bridges, `platform::lnx` namespace — `linux` is a macro
  under gnu dialects; each seam slice replaces its stub with its real impl
  file); CMake MSYS2 block guarded WIN32 + `remoct_linux_seams` OBJECT target.
  Verified: Windows baseline 13/13 BEFORE changes, regression 13/13 AFTER;
  Linux CI steps rehearsed in WSL2 (configure rc=0, stubs -Wall/-Wextra/
  -Wpedantic clean, ctest 4/4); then the real matrix green on push.
- **iHeart rabbit-hole desync — CLOSED WITH EVIDENCE** (2026-07-03 analysis
  session; no code, analysis of `logs/iheart/` = 38 deep-log captures, 4,783
  reconciliation ticks over 34.2 h, + the 07-02 operational log). Findings:
  - **Stage-B promotion: REJECTED.** Its trigger (a fresh parallel session's
    live edge showing music before the primary) occurred **0 times in 8
    instrumented Stage-A episodes** — the lane sat on ads up to 115 s until the
    primary's break cleared on its own, every time. iHeart's SSAI stitches new
    joiners into ad pods too; the premise is false in every observed case.
    **Faster manifest polling + staggered-peek machinery: also rejected** —
    deferred behind this capture, killed by the same premise.
  - **edgeLag is FLAT (never exceeded 2 segments in 598 polls, incl. a 1,091 s
    ad span):** we never fall behind the manifest edge — the desync is in WHAT
    the edge serves, not our lag. edgeLag-gated re-pin is dead.
  - **The 35 s LIVE_STALL fallback is validated and well-placed:** 16/85 Live
    runs self-resolved <30 s (stall correctly silent); all 68 stalled runs
    ended in a Song commit (fire ~+41 s observed, recover by 60–89 s total).
  - **The real holes split in two:** Class A (unfixable-by-design — one unpaid
    cartcutId looping 8–12 min while iHeart's OWN trackHistory/ctm reported no
    current song: broadcast-side break, nothing to rejoin) vs Class B
    (session-side staleness with OOB-PROVEN live music, ~1 per ~6 h, 131–300 s,
    and no mechanism arms from committed-Ad today) → the parked Class-B
    OOB-gated re-pin candidate above. Signal quality: 3 mfCls flickers and
    zero manifest freezes in 34.2 h.
- **Canonical SET_SPEED in CDSource::open — RESOLVED** (commit `d2ad038`; the
  slice-8 parked improvement). The resurrected baseline intent: open() now
  issues `dev_->setSpeed(0xFFFF)` through the ICdIo seam (the canonical 12-byte
  CDROM_SET_SPEED control-run C proved works) at the exact site where the
  hand-rolled 6-byte no-op was dropped. Value decision: **0xFFFF** — baseline
  author's stated intent, CDRipper's own restore convention, and most drives'
  unset default, so the common fresh-open case sounds unchanged; what's new is
  DETERMINISM in the pathological case (a rip aborted mid-Pass-2 no longer
  leaves the drive at 10x for subsequent playback). Rejected: 176/1x (real
  underrun hazard — refill rate == consumption rate leaves no headroom to
  rebuild the ring cushion after a seek flush); 1764/10x quiet-mid held as a
  NAMED FALLBACK, taken only if the listen gate ever finds max audibly
  objectionable (evidence-first, not speculative). Contract in the net:
  cd_toc_test asserts exactly one setSpeed(0xFFFF) on successful open, zero on
  failed open. CDRipper zero diff. Gate: live playback on drive G — 10 s clean
  (no stalls), seek landed, close clean; ctest 13/13.
- **VBR bitrate readout — RESOLVED as a product decision** (commit `adacbb1`).
  The survey finding that decided it: the "live VBR estimate" was a linear
  position model (`(pos/dur)·file_size`, differentiated) whose steady-state
  derivative is constant BY CONSTRUCTION — it never showed local-frame VBR
  variation, only the file average made less accurate (tag/album-art bytes
  inflate file_size, +2-4%) with a seek spike (76-90k kbps in the one delta
  window that swallowed the jump; A/B-probed identical on pre-slice-B baseline
  `3d4e061` — pre-existing, slice B exonerated). Decision (a): return TagLib's
  nominal/average for VBR exactly as CBR/lossless already did; one-shot static
  size/duration fallback for tagless files; estimator + 3 mutable members
  retired (net −40 lines). Renamed `liveBitrateKbps` → `bitrateKbps` — names
  are documentation; the old name re-forms the wrong mental model. Rejected:
  (b) label-as-instantaneous (enshrines a misreading — it never was),
  (d) spike-suppress-only (keeps fictional liveness to preserve noise).
  Gate: probe across a forward seek — VBR pinned 264/264/264 (was peak
  90,569), CBR 256 steady, FLAC 967 steady; ctest 13/13.
- **Phase 2 slice B — LocalFileSource extraction: DONE** (commit `845a155`).
  The file path became the third ISource implementation: `include/
  LocalFileSource.h` + `src/LocalFileSource.cpp` (open_decoder/prime_decoder/
  populate_track_info moved verbatim; seek-prime + cursor moved verbatim into
  methods; TrackInfo hoisted to `include/TrackInfo.h`, zero call-site changes).
  **The crux (correctness argument ratified before code):** initCrossfade's
  audio-thread by-value ma_decoder struct copy became a pointer move under the
  IDENTICAL `next_decoder_initialised_` release/acquire protocol — the atomic
  appears in the diff only as unchanged context. The outgoing source is
  **retired, not freed** (audio thread parks it in retired_src_; pollEvents
  reaps on the main thread under the existing track_swap_flag_ synchronizes-
  with edge) — closing latent baseline race F2 (UI-thread positionSec vs the
  swap): the raced deref now always hits a live decoder, strictly narrower
  than the baseline's torn-struct read, and the audio callback no longer
  frees heap. Bonus: removes reliance on ma_decoder being trivially
  relocatable. Audio-thread diff = exactly three enumerated change classes
  (swap block, reads→readFrames at the same sites, guards); effect chains and
  per-mode branches byte-identical; StreamSource/CDSource/CDRipper zero diff.
  Named residuals/removals in lessons.md. Verified: ctest 13/13 (xfade +S5
  replace-preload, added test-first), 5× stable; headless mechanics gate ALL
  PASS (MP3 seek storm, varispeed 1.50× + boundary suppression, repeat-one,
  device-switch continuity, 11 h .m4b, **88.9 M positionSec reads hammered
  through a live crossfade swap**); live listen gate passed on 7of9
  (crossfade/gapless/varispeed/MP3 seek-prime/chapters — "works as previous").
- **Phase 2 slice A — core::ISource + push sources: DONE** (commit `0b7acf4`).
  `include/core/ISource.h` (new, platform-free, standalone-compile verified):
  readFrames (audio-callback contract, fixed 44100/stereo/f32; ring-backed
  sources always return frame_count and signal end via their own state —
  pull-decoded sources short-read at EOF, slice B) / caps (seekable, finite,
  live — declared, never faked) / positionSec / durationSec / seekTo / close.
  open()/metadata/pause deliberately excluded (Decisions log). StreamSource
  implements it with **zero .cpp hunks** (positionSec widened int→double
  inline; caps=live; durationSec=0; seekTo=false); CDSource with three
  byte-equivalent signature harmonizations (seekTo(int)→bool seekTo(double),
  position/duration int→double — integer math preserved, widened) + caps=
  seekable+finite; CD's extended surface stays concrete. AudioManager: exactly
  4 consumer casts; UIManager + CDRipper compiled unchanged. The slice-0 net
  retargeted through `core::ISource&` — the fidelity/prebuffer assertions now
  also prove interface dispatch — plus new contract blocks per source. Audit:
  sacred-symbol grep over the diff = zero hits; virtual dispatch added only on
  UI-thread query paths (the audio callback still reads through concrete
  members — dispatch there is slice C, deferred). Build clean, ctest 13/13,
  repeated-run stable.
- **Phase 2 slice 0 — thin replay net: DONE** (commit `7adae12`). Three tests
  that lock down the producer/consumer audio-machinery SEMANTICS headlessly,
  through the seams Phase 1 built — the safety net decision #1 required before
  the Source-interface refactor touches the audio path (a diff audit protects
  code that moves unopened; these protect the seams the refactor deliberately
  changes). Zero production-code changes; ctest 13/13, stable across repeated
  runs. **This is Phase 2's regression net: slice A retargets these tests
  through `ISource*` and every subsequent slice gates on them.**
  - `cd_pipeline_test`: FakeCdIo through the REAL CDSource playback pipeline
    (playTrack → readerWorker → SPSC ring → readFrames). Byte-exact PCM fidelity
    across the thread boundary (never-zero pattern keyed on absolute disc
    position), seek flush/restart at target LBA, pause continuity, consumer-stall
    backpressure, transient-error silence-fill (exactly count×1176 zeros
    in-stream, LBA advanced), media-removal hard stop + latch, stopReader-leaves-
    device-open (the CDRipper handoff), playback-never-requests-C2.
  - `hls_pipeline_test`: FakeHttp via `core::setHttp()` through the REAL
    StreamSource HLS/AAC pipeline (open → hlsConnect → producerWorkerAAC →
    segment pump → FDK decode → ring → readFrames) — the Phase-0 Tier-2
    record/replay idea realized cheaply on the slice-4 seam. Synthetic manifests
    + REAL ADTS generated at test start by FDK-encoding a sine (no binary
    fixtures in the repo). Prebuffer, live-window stall → underrun → rebuffer
    self-heal, timed-ID3 (TIT2/TPE1) → nowPlaying, and the prompt-close cancel
    gate: close() during a wedged segment fetch returned in **16 ms** with the
    cancel token observed at the fake transport — the slice-4 "mid-segment stop
    <1 s" property now runs on every ctest, headlessly.
  - `xfade_handoff_test`: REAL AudioManager on generated WAVs through a real
    MUTED device — the swap-adjacent file path slice B restructures: gapless EOF
    short-read → audio-thread swap → track_swap_flag_ → pollEvents install
    ordering (swap lands before the track-end callback fires), crossfade
    trigger/two-decoder mix/isCrossfading visibility/completion (a preload
    event, NOT a track_end), clearNext mid-crossfade (the device-stop quiesce
    branch), end-without-preload. Needs audio hardware: SKIPs (exit 77) when no
    device opens, so the cd/hls tests remain the always-on net.
  - **Honest limits:** the ICY/continuous path (rawRead → InternetReadFile, raw
    WinINet by design) cannot be replayed headlessly — live gates only. Real-time
    callback cadence, device bring-up ordering, and real ad-pod re-pin timing
    also stay with the 7of9 live gates.
- **Phase 1 slice 8 — CD-I/O seam (Windows CD IOCTLs → core::ICdIo): DONE**
  (commit `14aebec`). The LAST platform seam, BUILT INTO the slice-5 boundary:
  `include/core/ICdIo.h` + `src/platform/win/CdIoWin.cpp` (`platform::win::WinCdIo`
  / `WinCdDevice`). Interface = raw optical-drive transport, 8 primitives modeled on
  the two real consumers: factory `open(drive-spec)` → device object (dtor closes;
  concurrent opens of one drive are CONTRACT — CDSource holds its device for playback
  while CDRipper opens a second per rip), `readToc` (raw MSF handed over — MSF→LBA
  math and the "do NOT subtract 150" contract stay consumer-side),
  `lastSessionFirstTrack` (the one value the Enhanced-CD detect consumes), `readRaw`
  (lba/sectors/want_c2/buffer/got), `setSpeed`, `mediaPresent`, `model`. Every impl
  method is ONE baseline DeviceIoControl moved parameter-identical (the lba*2048
  DiskOffset quirk now impl-side). `want_c2` is an EXPLICIT flag — advisory on
  Windows (buffer size IS the request, the baseline shape) but it's what SG_IO's CDB
  error-field bits need at Phase 3; buffer-size-implies-C2 was the one
  Windows-only assumption in the baseline and it's gone. Bytes-returned (`got`) is
  surfaced — the C2 probe (`got == 2646`) and the de-interleave branch depend on it.
  ALL rip/disc logic stayed consumer-side (the IHttp/IIpc/INotify split): AR CRC
  math, 150-sector preamble, normalizeSkip/arPreambleReadable, disc-ID
  normalization, frame450 sweep, Enhanced-CD silence search + +174, retry/
  silence-fill, cache-flush, C2 interpretation, drive-offset table.
  **Ownership: ctor injection per consumer** (the slice-6/7 pattern, now ×2):
  `CDSource(ICdIo* = nullptr)` + `CDRipper(ICdIo* = nullptr)` defaulting to
  `core::cdio()` (link-time bridge only, no setCdio()). Header detox rode along as
  designed: CDSource.h no longer includes windows.h/ntddcdrm.h (AudioManager/
  UIManager stop inheriting Windows from this path); CDTrack + MBLookup TOC params
  DWORD→uint32_t, type-only. CDSource's hand-rolled 6-byte SET_SPEED was DROPPED,
  not migrated — probe-confirmed rejected by cdrom.sys with ERROR_BAD_LENGTH, a
  lifelong silent no-op (see parked item). Unified open flags (ripper's shape;
  CDSource residuals inert and documented in lessons.md). New `cd_toc_test`
  (10th ctest target): FakeCdIo via ctor injection through the REAL CDSource —
  Relish-shaped non-standard pregap (T1 @ LBA 182), Enhanced-CD data track +
  session-2 leadout, malformed-TOC clamps, model→offset lookup, media checks.
  **Two-layer verified: ctest 10/10 + THE hardware gate** — Joan Osborne Relish
  ripped through the seam on the GHD3N: 12/12 AR v2 conf 200, per-track
  crc_v1/crc_v2, all 12 pcm_crc32, frame450 global/local, the T1 first-16-samples
  dump, and "C2 support: no" ALL byte-identical to the pre-migration baseline log
  (diff-verified line-by-line); .bin cache saved; CD playback + seek through the
  seam confirmed, with the two-concurrent-opens contract exercised live.
- **Phase 1 slice 7 — notifications seam (Toast/PowerShell → core::INotify): DONE**
  (commit `dde7041`). Third seam BUILT INTO the slice-5 boundary:
  `include/core/INotify.h` + `src/platform/win/NotifyWinToast.cpp`
  (`platform::win::WinToastNotify`; `git mv` from src/Toast.cpp — rename held at 64%,
  injection-fix history preserved). Interface = "show the user a transient
  notification": ONE primitive, `notify(title, body)` — two strings, no icon/duration
  params (the baseline never set either; ToastImageAndText02's image slot was never
  populated). Contract is the baseline's: fire-and-forget, non-blocking (the win impl
  spawns PowerShell from a detached thread, 5 s bounded reap, CREATE_NO_WINDOW),
  best-effort with NO error reporting (baseline swallowed CreateProcess failure),
  callable from any thread (impl stateless per call). CONTENT stayed consumer-side —
  the IHttp/IIpc protocol/transport split: Toast.h is now a header-only, platform-free
  content adapter, `showTrackToast(title, artist, album, INotify&)`, keeping the
  baseline mapping verbatim (artist PREPENDS the title: "Artist - Title"; empty album
  → "RE-MOCT" body) including its status-shape inversion (("Streaming", station, "")
  → "station - Streaming" — baseline, not fixed). The escape/UTF-16LE/base64
  `-EncodedCommand`/CreateProcess transport block moved byte-identical (one identifier
  rename, `esc(top)`→`esc(title)`; emitted bytes unchanged) — that block fixed a real
  quote-injection bug and is frozen. The `'RE-MOCT'` CreateToastNotifier id stays
  impl-side (platform attribution — the Linux twin's `notify-send -a`).
  **Ownership: constructor injection again** — UIManager is the ONE consumer class
  (33 call sites, all in UIManager.cpp): `UIManager(..., core::INotify* = nullptr)`
  defaulting to `core::notifier()` (link-time bridge only, no `setNotify()`; named
  notifier() to avoid the notify().notify() stutter). A private 3-arg member wrapper
  hides the 4-arg adapter, so all 33 call sites compiled textually unchanged. New
  `notify_toast_test` (9th ctest target, portable — no PowerShell/process spawn):
  FakeNotify through the REAL Toast.h adapter, 8 cases (mapping branches, the
  dominant (msg,"","") status shape, the Streaming inversion, adapter-must-NOT-escape
  — escaping is the transport's job — and call ordering). Two-layer verified:
  ctest 9/9 + live gate on this machine — toasts fire from the real triggers (track
  change, status toggles), quote-injection ('/") and accented-metadata (Björk) probes
  confirmed in Action Center, synchronous script run exit 0 (Show() succeeded).
- **Phase 1 slice 6 — IPC seam (Discord named-pipe → core::IIpc): DONE** (commit
  `89285d8`). First seam BUILT INTO the slice-5 boundary: `include/core/IIpc.h` +
  `src/platform/win/IpcWinPipe.cpp` (`platform::win::WinPipeIpc`). Interface =
  "local bidirectional byte channel", three primitives modeled on the one real
  consumer: `send` (whole buffer, ONE OS write — Discord's framing breaks on split
  writes), `waitReadable(min_bytes, timeout_ms)` (bounded peek-poll, 10 ms baseline
  granularity preserved in the impl), `recvSome` (one blocking OS read; callers
  loop). `IIpc::connect(logical-name)` — the impl owns name→path mapping
  (`\\.\pipe\<name>`; Linux `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<name>` at Phase 3). The asymmetric
  read shape is deliberate parity: bounded header wait, UNbounded body reads —
  a higher-level `recvExact(timeout)` would have invented semantics the baseline
  doesn't have. Protocol stayed consumer-side in DiscordRP (framing, the
  discord-ipc-0..9 probe, handshake, 1 MB squatter cap, CLOSE handling, lazy
  reconnect, payload/nonce/escape) — the IHttp protocol/transport split.
  **Ownership: constructor injection, NOT a second transitional global** —
  `DiscordRP(app_id, core::IIpc* = nullptr)` defaulting to `core::ipc()` (declared
  in core, defined in the impl TU — link-time bridge only, no `setIpc()`); one
  consumer with one obvious injection point didn't justify the http()/setHttp()
  pattern, and the ctor param IS the DI endgame shape. DiscordRP.cpp is
  pipe-API-free (`windows.h` only for `GetCurrentProcessId`, the IHeartRadio
  shape); DiscordRP.h no longer includes `windows.h` at all (UIManager.h stops
  inheriting it from this path). New `discord_ipc_test` (8th ctest target):
  FakeIpc via ctor injection asserts handshake bytes, probe order, SET_ACTIVITY
  framing + jsonEscape, activity-null clear, CLOSE→reject, and
  reconnect-after-death. Two-layer verified: ctest 8/8 + live Discord on this
  machine — RP with title/artist/art, track-change update, Discord-restart
  reconnect, clear-on-toggle (all four gates). `src/platform/linux/` still
  deliberately absent.
- **Phase 1 slice 5 — core/platform directory reorg (HTTP seam only): DONE** (commit
  `1977539`). Pure relocation — `git mv include/IHttp.h include/core/IHttp.h` +
  `git mv src/HttpWinInet.cpp src/platform/win/HttpWinInet.cpp` (both true renames,
  95%/98% similarity — history preserved). Include statements changed to
  `#include "core/IHttp.h"` across all 15 referencing sites (2 headers, 7 src
  consumers, the impl, 5 tests) — chosen over adding `include/core` to the search
  path so the layer boundary is visible at every include site and future core
  headers follow the same pattern with zero extra CMake. CMake: main target + 4
  test targets' `HttpWinInet.cpp` paths updated; no include-dir changes (`include/`
  already on every target's path). Diff surface: 18 files, 29+/29− — provably
  move-plus-paths only. Verified: clean reconfigure+rebuild (rm -rf build) 50/50,
  ctest 7/7 same results, remoct.exe launches and plays a local file.
  **Deliberately scoped to the one finished seam** — reorg-first on known-good code
  establishes the boundary once; IPC / notifications / CD-IOCTL get built into it,
  not relocated later. `src/platform/linux/` NOT created — it's the libcurl (+ Unix
  socket, libnotify, SG_IO) home when Phase 3 arrives.
- **Phase 1 slice 4 — HTTP seam, sites 7 & 8 (the audio-thread pair): DONE** (commit
  `4c72b09`). **HTTP consolidation 8/8 — fully closed.** `core::IHttp` gained the two
  capabilities the audio sites needed, both defaulting inert (six shipped sites
  byte-identical):
  - **Cancellation:** `HttpRequest::cancel` (`const std::atomic<bool>*`, polled before
    open + before each chunk read — baseline `stop_` granularity) + `HttpResponse::
    cancelled` (ok=false, partial body CLEARED via pure `finalizeCancelled()`), so a
    consumer's own stop is never mistaken for network death (reconnect/backoff safe).
  - **Persistent sessions:** `IHttpSession` + `IHttp::openSession(HttpSessionConfig)`
    with a default forwarding impl (fakes/tests unchanged); `WinInetSession` holds one
    `InternetOpen` handle (UA + timeouts at creation) and adds KEEP_CONNECTION per
    fetch. Session lifetime is the caller's: hls dies in `disconnect()` (fresh per
    re-handshake/re-pin), IHeart lives with the object — exact baseline lifetimes.
  - Also: `pragma_no_cache` request field (both audio baselines sent it; default off)
    and `read_error` response flag — an implementation-time survey correction (hls
    FAILS on a mid-body read error, unlike the other six; a partial segment must not
    reach the decoder). Accepted residuals recorded in `lessons.md`.
  - StreamSource: only `disconnect`/`hlsEnsureSession`/`hlsHttpGet` touched (3 diff
    hunks); `InternetReadFile` remains ONLY in `rawRead` (live loop), `InternetOpenUrl`
    only in `connect()`'s ICY branch. IHeartRadio.cpp is now **WinINet-free** (nullptr
    cancel — boundedness stays the deliberate 5 s timeout; wiring `stop_` into its
    polls is a parked, separate decision).
  - Tests 7/7: `http_seam_test` +4 pure cases; new `http_cancel_test` (localhost
    socket fixture — mid-body abort 373 ms, keep-alive reuse = 1 connection observed,
    pre-cancelled = zero network); new `iheart_request_test` (real consumer + injected
    fake, all three endpoints). Two-layer verified: real-world on 7of9 — digital iHeart
    plays clean, **mid-segment stop aborts <1 s** (the regression this design must not
    introduce), stop-during-switch clean, now-playing + Discord art intact, ad-onset
    re-pin a non-event, ICY/SHOUTcast behaviorally unregressed.
- **Phase 1 slice 3 — HTTP seam, group (c): DONE** (commit `dd5f792`, pushed). CoverArt
  (`bytesByMbid`, `httpGet`) + CDRipper (AR `.bin`, CTDB) migrated to `core::http().fetch()`;
  **both files WinINet-free** (CoverArt now portable — no `windows.h`). New interface
  capability exercised for real: `RedirectPolicy` enum (FollowAll default = byte-identical to
  the old `follow_redirects=true`; **FollowSameScheme** for CAA cross-scheme-downgrade
  protection); `finalizeBody()` **clears** the body on `reject_truncated`+truncated (CoverArt's
  10 MB reject/clear); plain-HTTP AR/CTDB get **no SECURE flag** (scheme-derived via
  `urlIsSecureScheme`). Per-call UAs preserved (CTDB short, AR/CAA default). Tests: pure
  extensions (byte passthrough, `final_url`, clear-on-reject, `urlIsSecureScheme`) + Windows-only
  `group_c_request_test`. Two-layer verified: `ctest` 5/5 + real-world on 7of9 (Joan Osborne
  12/12 AR v2 conf 200 byte-identical through the seam's plain-HTTP AR fetch, `.bin` still
  saved; cover art resolves in tags + Discord RPC).
  - **HTTP consolidation now 6/8 sites migrated** (a: MBLookup, RadioBrowser; b: LastFm,
    ListenBrainz; c: CoverArt, CDRipper) — this closes the *straightforward* HTTP work. The
    remaining two (`hlsHttpGet`, IHeart metadata) both touch the audio pipeline and are
    deferred go/no-go items needing a cancel token / persistent-session design.
  - Minor: CTDB's two distinct failure log lines collapsed to the generic `HTTP: 0` block
    (result preserved: false/inconclusive) — cosmetic.
- **Phase 1 slice 2 — HTTP seam, group (b): DONE** (commit `7c13baf`, pushed). LastFm +
  ListenBrainz GET/POST helpers migrated to `core::http().fetch()`; **both files now
  WinINet-free** (ListenBrainz has no `windows.h` at all — portable). Added the seam's
  **non-GET path** (`InternetCrackUrlW`→`InternetConnectW`→`HttpOpenRequestW`→
  `HttpSendRequestW`); the request **body is sent as raw UTF-8 bytes, never widened**.
  Signing (md5 `api_sig`), body-building, and status gating (`accepted()` on HTTP 200)
  stay consumer-side. POST path sets CONNECT+RECEIVE only (no SEND — matches the scrobble
  baseline). Interface unchanged — the slice-1 `body`/`content_type`/`headers` fields
  covered it. Added transitional `core::setHttp()` injection hook + Windows-only
  `scrobble_request_test`. Two-layer verified: `ctest` 4/4 + real-world Björk/Jóga scrobble
  round-trip on Last.fm + ListenBrainz (accents intact — raw-UTF-8 wire path confirmed;
  ListenBrainz status gate exercised on a live submit).
  - Remaining HTTP: group (c) — CoverArt, CDRipper (AR/CTDB, plain-HTTP), StreamSource
    `hlsHttpGet` (bytes + `final_url`); IHeart metadata still its own deferred go/no-go.
- **Phase 1 slice 1 — HTTP seam, group (a): FIXED/DONE** (commit `94eb8cb`, pushed).
  `core::IHttp` interface (`include/IHttp.h`, portable — no `windows.h`) +
  `platform::win::WinInetHttp` impl (`src/HttpWinInet.cpp`, `if(WIN32)`). MBLookup +
  RadioBrowser GET helpers now call `core::http().fetch()`. Parity verified vs baseline:
  4 MB cap both, RadioBrowser 6 s timeout, MBLookup no timeout, default UA byte-identical,
  HTTP status ignored, WinINet default redirect-follow. FakeHttp-backed `http_seam_test`
  added (real parse shapes: RadioBrowser `url_resolved`→`url` fallback, MB nested
  `artist-credit`). Two-layer verified: `ctest` 3/3 + real-world on 7of9 (Relish MB lookup
  resolved metadata; RadioBrowser "kwin" search returned KWIN 97.7).
  - `core::http()` is a TRANSITIONAL global (endgame = injection; see `architecture.md`).
  - At the later `src/core` + `src/platform/{win,linux}` reorg, `IHttp.h` moves to
    `include/core/` and `HttpWinInet.cpp` to `src/platform/win/`. (Done — slice 5.)
  - Remaining HTTP work (groups b, c, IHeart) tracked under Phase 1 above.
- **CDRipper negative drive-offset preamble OOB read + wrong CRC phase: FIXED**
  (commit `1a2235a`). Floored offset decomposition (`ar::normalizeSkip`) + signed
  preamble guard (`ar::arPreambleReadable`) extracted into `ar_crc.h` and wired into
  `CDRipper::ripTrack`; the 150-sector preamble is untouched. Covered by `ar_crc_test`
  (invariants, OOB-index witness, phase/CRC equivalence on a synthetic disc,
  boundaries); the +6 path is unregressed (Joan Osborne re-rip 12/12 AR v2 conf 200,
  byte-identical CRCs).
  - Open: real negative-offset **hardware** validation remains a HydrogenAudio
    cross-check item — the synthetic suite proves the logic, not on-drive behavior.

## Parked / deferred (not disturbed)
- **`port::logDir()` doesn't create the grandparent** (slice-1 residual, found
  at the slice-2 gates): it mkdirs `$HOME/.local/state` and `re-moct` but not
  `~/.local` — on a fresh account the operational log silently no-ops. Windows
  unaffected (%TEMP% always exists). Fix = `std::filesystem::create_directories`
  as its own tiny change.
- **radio-browser mirror list refresh:** nl1/at1 are DNS-dead (de1 alive, the
  fallback loop copes). Refresh the list — or resolve mirrors via the
  documented `all.api.radio-browser.info` DNS rotation — someday.
- **Latent baseline OOB on corrupt multi-session TOCs:** CDSource's session-2 block
  indexes `entries[toc2.last]` unclamped (baseline did the same with TrackData) — a
  corrupt disc reporting last>99 over-reads the array. Preserved as-is in slice 8
  (no ride-along logic); fix alongside the session-2 guards as its own change.
- **Wire `stop_` into IHeart's metadata polls as a cancel token:** would cut worst-case
  `close()` latency by ~5 s. Deliberately NOT done in slice 4 (a behavior improvement,
  not parity) — take it only as its own decided change.
- **Prompt interrupt of a fully stalled connect/read** (cross-thread handle-close):
  baseline gap that slice 4 intentionally preserved (parity); the existing note in
  `StreamSource::close()` still stands. Future hardening item.
- **Track Info album tag decode:** an album field with accented chars (`é`) renders as
  `??` in the Track Info panel (same neighborhood as the earlier `¿` on the 4 Non Blondes
  filename) — a local tag-read/display decode artifact. **NOT in the scrobble path** (album
  isn't scrobbled to Recent Tracks; artist/title were clean over the wire — confirmed in
  group (b)). A separate local tag-decode thread to look at later.
- **Class-B OOB-gated re-pin (PARKED, not greenlit — from the 2026-07-03 desync
  analysis):** extend the existing 35 s stall re-pin to also fire from the
  COMMITTED-AD state when gated on out-of-band liveness — sketch: `stState==Ad`
  sustained >60–90 s WHILE trackHistory/ctm shows a current fresh song. Targets
  the fixable hole class exactly (session loops a stale slate while OOB proves
  the broadcast returned): observed ~1 per ~6 h of listening, 131–300 s each
  (sharpest case: 206 s with thCurrent on 8/9 ticks and TWO fresh songs seen
  out-of-band). Reuses the re-pin mechanism that went 68-for-68 → Song in the
  corpus; adds no new machinery; the OOB gate was false throughout every
  broadcast-side (Class A) hole, so it can't fire into a real break. **Honest
  caveat: a fresh handshake DURING a Class-B hole was never captured — "re-pin
  escapes the stuck session" is strongly plausible but not directly proven; the
  first live gate settles it. This is a real audio-path change (re-pin from a
  new state): full design-first pass + Dos sign-off when chosen, not before.**
- **Retire the Stage-A staging-lane scaffold (optional cleanup, own change):**
  inert logging-only observer; its data did its job (killed Stage-B). No
  urgency — costs nothing dormant. Do NOT fold into other commits.
- Scrobble back-to-back duplicate: source commits from debounced `IHNow` + TTL dedup.
- StreamSource `isOpen()` race (consumed in staging lane, defer); `driveOffsetKnown()`
  always-false (skip, no payoff); AAC re-pin doesn't reset FDK (defer, ADTS resyncs).
- ICY/SHOUTcast metadata improvement (structural protocol limit); ICY ingest
  sanitization (station-ID stripping).
- Comb-filter / harmonic-sum tempogram for BPM (shelved).

## Decisions log
- **Slice C declined — Phase 2 closed at A+B (2026-07-03).** Dispatch
  uniformity in the audio callback would add a second source of truth for the
  playing mode (a cross-thread `active_src_` pointer that every transition must
  keep agreeing with the mode flags) plus a fourth audio-thread change class
  (the pointer staleness at every crossfade swap — the F2/retirement lesson
  replayed), while the single-active-source abstraction is factually WRONG
  during a crossfade (two live sources; 3 of 6 call sites can't use it — the
  hlsHttpGet lesson at callback scale: if the abstraction requires pretending,
  it's wrong). No Phase 3/4 dependency. The per-mode branches are semantics,
  not debt. **Revisit only if Phase 4's plugin registry generates a concrete
  need — and design it there, not here.**
- **Phase 2 ISource contract (approved 2026-07-02): model the real four, don't
  force uniformity.** `core::ISource` = readFrames/caps/positionSec/durationSec/
  seekTo/close at `include/core/ISource.h` (first core-owned non-platform
  contract; Phase 3 sources and Phase 4 plugins implement the same interface).
  What made a uniform frame contract honest: all paths already converged on
  fixed 44100/stereo/f32, and StreamSource/CDSource::readFrames are deliberately
  identical. Deliberate EXCLUSIONS: **`open()` stays out** (three irreconcilable
  open shapes — file path, stream URL + async-connect orchestration that must
  stay in AudioManager, CD drive+track container; a uniform open(string) would
  push connect orchestration into sources or fake a CD URL scheme — Phase 4's
  problem, the ABI-leak to resist). **Metadata stays out** (least-uniform facet:
  file = full TagLib upfront, CD = TOC + external MB lookup, stream = time-
  varying nowPlaying/art; the unified-metadata trap is where a Phase-4 shape
  sneaks in — grow later per the RedirectPolicy precedent if a real consumer
  needs it). CD's extended surface (TOC/offset/model/stopReader/checkMedia,
  consumed by CDRipper + UIManager) stays concrete beside the interface.
  **Standing rule: if any of the four sources needs pretending to fit, that's
  stop-and-redesign, not push-through.** Slice C (callback dispatch) is optional
  and declinable — the per-mode callback branches gate logic that must not unify.
- **Slice 0 net-first (decision #1, 2026-07-02): thin replay net before the
  refactor, not the full capture harness and not bare diff audits.** Diff audits
  protect what moves unopened (slices 4/8 proved that); the new timing risk is at
  the seams the refactor deliberately changes (callback dispatch, teardown
  ordering, crossfade swap). The Phase-1 seams (setHttp/FakeCdIo) made the net a
  1-session build vs 3-5 for a full instrumented capture harness.
- **300ms post-track-change seek lockout: REJECTED.** Silent dropped seeks in every
  track-change window were worse than the rare benign held-key leak they prevented.
  The track-stamp guard (discard a buffered seek if the track changed) was kept — it's
  costless and prevents the genuinely-wrong case with no deadzone.
- **Crossfade head-completion: UI-only.** Read the existing `crossfading_` atomic via
  `isCrossfading()` and let the comet head ride to 100% while crossfading; releases
  cleanly when the swap clears the flag. No audio-thread changes. Awesome-mode only;
  Classic keeps MOC's snap.
- **Don't carve the ABI first.** Internal compile-time interface → prove → then DLL.
- **Probe-first** for any new parsing/protocol work.
